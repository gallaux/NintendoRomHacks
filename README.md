# Nintendo Rom Hacks
Nintendo rom hacks/patches in IPS format (Use a patching utility such as [Lunar IPS](https://www.romhacking.net/utilities/240/) to patch your roms).
These improvement patches are fully compatible with real hardware and unlock extra content/features that would normally only be accessible via cheat codes or devices such as the Action Replay, Game Genie, or GameShark.

All my hacks can be found on [romhacking.net](https://www.romhacking.net/community/7786/)!
